## PROJECTS 

### MPG Fuel Project (Intro to Data Analysis and Machine Learning) Dec 2022
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alishaminj12/MPG-Fuel-Project-)
- Predicted vehicle MPG through a regression model and analyzed the impact of variables on fuel efficiency. Discovered insights on how MPG varies across fuel types, including average MPG per type and identifying the fuel type with the highest average MPG. 
- Collaborated with a team of two members to build the model and compared the results to choose the best model. Utilized Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy packages for data cleaning, data manipulation, and model development. 
- Determined diesel fuel as the fuel type with the highest average MPG among all fuel types.

### Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Platforms for Big Data Processing) Dec 2022
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alishaminj12/Final_Project)
- Examined the 2020 BRFSS Dataset from 463,323 adults, studying the impact of substance use disorder on health and uncovering a strong correlation with the risk of heart attacks.
- Implemented a logistic regression model using Databricks and Apache Spark, achieving an accuracy of 0.362697 and precision of 0.265. Maintained a high AUC and recall of 1.000. Identified areas for improving the F1 score to enhance the model's performance.
- Uncovered valuable insights into preventive health factors and risk behaviors linked to chronic diseases. Potential for significant impact on public health interventions and policies, example, 20% reduction in chronic disease occurrence and 30% decrease in hospitalizations related to chronic conditions.

### Transition to Renewable Energy: A Decade-long Study (Stats & Visualization) May 2022  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alishaminj12/Transition-to-Renewable-Energy)
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Python and Plotly to visualize world economic development trends and identify meaningful insights and correlations in global development patterns.
- Investigated datasets of 10 countries, examining indicators such as electricity production, consumption of gaseous fuel, and production from natural gas, coal, and oil sources from 2010 to 2021.
- Created interactive line charts, bar charts, and bubble plots in Google Colab using Pandas and Matplotlib to compare indicators across countries and observe development patterns.
